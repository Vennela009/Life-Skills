## Good Practices for Software Development

### 1. Which points were new to you?

- Sometimes despite all efforts, the requirements are still vague. So during the implementation phase, get frequent feedback so that you are on track and everyone is on the same page.
- Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup.

### 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- Focus on task by avoiding the distractions.
- Relax when i am stressed and improve thinking capacity.
- Seeking help when i am get stuck.
- Explaning my problem clearly to the team members.
